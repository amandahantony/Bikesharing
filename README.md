# Bikesharing

## Overview of the Analysis 
In this analysis we used Tableau to create various visualizations based on CitiBike bike-sharing data. The visualizations are used to understand trends and CitiBike business in New York. From there, a solid business proposal can be created towards implementing a bike-sharing program in Des Moines. 

## Results

The above map shows that the darker and larger purple circles have a higher volume of Citibike riders starting their trip. Some locations such as 12th Ave (NW corner), Pershing Square (NE), West St. (SW corner), and E 17 St. are hotspots for starting CitiBike rides. These areas may have more tourists or a higher population.
