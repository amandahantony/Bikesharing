# Bikesharing

## Overview of the Analysis 
In this analysis we used Tableau to create various visualizations based on CitiBike bike-sharing data. The visualizations are used to understand trends and CitiBike business in New York. From there, a solid business proposal can be created towards implementing a bike-sharing program in Des Moines. 

## Results

Some locations such as 12th Ave (NW corner), Pershing Square (NE), West St. (SW corner), and E 17 St. are hotspots for starting CitiBike rides. These areas may have more tourists or a higher population.

Male subscribers take significantly more bike trips than females and unknown gender subscribers. Of all the male and female subscribers, a higher proportion use Citibike on Thursdays. Of all the unknown gender customers, a higher proprotion use Citibike on Saturdays.

## Summary 

The data and visualizations show that in the month of August a whopping 2,344,224 Citibike rides were taken. Some areas such as Pershing Square and 12th Ave. are hotspots for starting rides. These areas may have more tourists or a higher population, therefore requiring more bikes. The visualizations also show that the majority of Citibike trips are short (around 5 minutes), suggesting that most users are travelling short distances to local areas. However, this makes sense because most things and places and nearby when living in the city. During the weekdays, most rides begin around 7 to 9 am, as well as 5 to 6 pm.
